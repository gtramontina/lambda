## Fun with Lambda Calculus in JS

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gtramontina/lambda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gtramontina/lambda)

### Exploring:

```shell
$ node lambda.js
```

### Fiddling with it (`npm install` first):

```shell
$ npm test
```

#### Notes:

1. These are functions _all the way_, so expect your stack to grow real quick! :smile: You can increase it if you want with node's parameter `--stack-size=<n>`, as you can see in the test npm script.

2. I cheated a bit when using named lambda abstractions (for the sake of readability)

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed doing it! :heart: Perhaps you could add more examples…? :smile:
